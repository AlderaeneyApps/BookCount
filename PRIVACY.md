## Data usage

The app isn't designed to connect to any online service and doesn't include
any data collection services.

The app uses the camera permission to be able to add pictures to the
"Series" and "Volumes" the user creates and will not leave the user's device.

The app also uses the media storage permission to be able to store the app's database in a JSON formatted file,
and to be able to restore that database from the generated file on the same device if the app
was uninstalled or on another, new device.

The app doesn't access any other files from the device, only creates the exported database and
restores it from a file the user is asked to select.

### Licensing

The app is licensed as Free and Open Source Software using the GPLv3 license, if someone desires
they can check the source code and create and redistribute their own derivation.
